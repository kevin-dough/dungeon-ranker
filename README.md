# Dungeon Ranker
### Created by Kevin Do and Kian Kishimoto

## Description
Dungeon Ranker is a Hypixel Skyblock Dungeons Stat Tracker that allows users to receive a rank based on their stats and share it with others. Dungeon Ranker will use the Skyblock API to pull player data. To calculate the rank score, we will be using the number of secrets, catacombs level, floor completions and more.
	Users will input their Minecraft username into a textfield and submit it and the website will do the rest of the work of getting API data, displaying stats, and calculating a score.
